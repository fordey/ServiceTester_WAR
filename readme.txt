converted a spring boot application to build and deploy as a war .. using cargo maven plugin to deploy to a tomcat container. 
This app was developed for a specific need to look for an .xls file on the host machine.. this is not ideal as would have liked users to use an upload facility that i provided but was not to be..

Demonstrates:
-spring-boot
-spring config (java based)
-spring profiles
-spring-data (mongo db repo)
-mvn cargo plugin for deployments
-deploying a spring boot application as a war on tomcat container, 
-while still being able to use embedded tomcat in dev.

-apache POI
-XStream
-twitter bootstrap
-thymeleaf
-jquery + ajax
